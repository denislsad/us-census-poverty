This is the first part of the project, in which I analyze the Census data on poverty and incomes in the United States.
Here, I focus on the data on poverty. The next part is about income and income distribution. The latest available data from Census comes from the year 2021.

I'm interested in displaying trends over time for different groups (by age, race, and family type) and answering questions with statistical tests and visualization. This project is built around exploratory data analysis.

It consists of three sections. Each of them starts with a custom function definition, followed by the implementation of these functions and conclusions. Within these steps, I try to achieve the following:
1. Find out how the poverty situation changed for three age groups (children, adults, seniors) across five races (white, Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native) since the data started being collected (from 1959).

2. Explore the historical poverty based on five different measures (including or excluding benefit programs from the calculation).

3. Explore poverty in 2021 in the US by nine groups (age, sex, race, etc.).
